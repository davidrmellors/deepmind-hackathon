**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-powered-safety`
**Created**: September 24, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AI-Powered Safety Route Advisor for Cape Town
Project: SafeRoute AI
Event: Google DeepMind AI Hackathon - Cape Town
Duration: 6 hours (10am - 4pm)
Team Size: 3 developers
Date: 25, September 2025

Executive Summary
SafeRoute AI is an intelligent navigation assistant that helps Cape Town residents and visitors choose the safest routes to their destinations. By combining Google's routing capabilities with local crime data and AI-powered safety insights, the app provides route recommendations that prioritize personal safety without compromising convenience.
Value Proposition: \"Navigate Cape Town with confidence - get AI-powered route recommendations that prioritize your safety.\"

Problem Statement
Primary Problem
Cape Town residents face daily safety concerns when navigating the city, with crime rates varying significantly by neighborhood and time of day. Current navigation apps optimize for speed and distance but ignore safety considerations, leaving users vulnerable in high-crime areas.
Supporting Data

South Africa has a crime index of 75.4 (considered high globally)
Cape Town specifically experiences significant geographic variation in crime rates
85 people are murdered daily in South Africa (Q4 2024/2025 statistics)
Users need contextual safety information for route planning decisions

Target Users
Primary: Cape Town residents (locals, students, professionals)
Secondary: Tourists and visitors to Cape Town
Tertiary: Ride-sharing drivers and delivery personnel

Hackathon Requirements
This event will bring together developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts to collaborate, innovate, and build impactful solutions using cutting-edge Google AI technologies. The theme for the Hackathon is \"AI for Impact\" and participants will be required to come up with challenges under the following broad categories:

AgTech

EdTech

HealthTech

Fintech

GovTech"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Feature description provides clear context for safety-focused navigation app
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Cape Town residents, tourists, ride-sharing drivers
   ‚Üí Actions: route planning, safety assessment, navigation guidance
   ‚Üí Data: crime statistics, route information, real-time safety conditions
   ‚Üí Constraints: 6-hour hackathon timeline, Google AI technology requirement
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Real-time vs historical crime data preference]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Mobile app vs web app platform]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Integration with existing navigation services]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User requests safe route from A to B
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Core navigation, safety scoring, route comparison capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Route, SafetyScore, CrimeData, User, Location
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding data sources and platform"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Cape Town resident needs to travel from their current location to a destination and wants to choose the safest available route. They input their origin and destination, and the system provides multiple route options ranked by safety score, showing estimated travel time and safety factors for each route. The user selects their preferred balance of safety and convenience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is at location A and wants to go to location B, **When** they request route options, **Then** the system displays at least 2 route alternatives with safety scores and estimated travel times
2. **Given** multiple route options are displayed, **When** the user selects a route, **Then** the system provides turn-by-turn navigation with safety alerts for high-risk areas
3. **Given** a user is planning travel during high-crime hours (evening/night), **When** they request routes, **Then** the system prioritizes well-lit, populated routes even if longer
4. **Given** real-time safety conditions change, **When** a user is actively navigating, **Then** the system suggests route adjustments if a significantly safer alternative becomes available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no safe route exists between two locations?
- How does the system handle areas with no crime data available?
- What occurs when GPS signal is lost in high-crime areas?
- How does the system respond when the safest route would add more than 50% to travel time?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept user input of origin and destination locations within Cape Town metropolitan area
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate multiple route options between specified locations
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate and display safety scores for each route option
- **FR-004**: System MUST incorporate Cape Town crime data into safety scoring algorithm
- **FR-005**: System MUST consider time-of-day factors in safety assessments
- **FR-006**: System MUST display estimated travel time for each route option
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to select preferred route based on safety and time preferences
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide navigation guidance for selected routes
- **FR-009**: System MUST highlight high-risk areas along selected routes
